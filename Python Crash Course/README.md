# Python Crash Course, Third Edition by Eric Matthes

Reviewed by : Connor Blackard

## **Book Overview**

Python Crash Course is the world’s best-selling guide to the Python programming language. This fast-paced, thorough introduction will have you writing programs, solving problems, and developing functioning applications in no time.

You’ll start by learning basic programming concepts, such as variables, lists, classes, and loops, and practice writing clean code with exercises for each topic. You’ll also learn how to make your programs interactive and test your code safely before adding it to a project. You’ll put your new knowledge into practice by creating a Space Invaders–inspired arcade game, building a set of data visualizations with Python’s handy libraries, and deploying a simple application online.[^1]

## Why I Chose This Book
 
I started this book after I was adding my latest GIAC course to my LinkedIn and noticed I had Python listed as a skill. While I took a Python course in college, used it somewhat frequently in my first role, I had not been hands on with the tool in quite some time. As I thought about whether I wanted to keep the skill listed or remove it, I decided I wanted it to remain but also acknowledged that I needed to have the proficiency to back it up. I looked for a book that would jog my memory of past experiences while also helping me with concepts I was always a bit uncertain of.

## How Long Did The Book Take

The book was has twenty chapters and is split into two parts. The first part of the book, eleven chapters, is geared toward learning Python as a while and the second part of the book, nine chapters covers three projects, a 2D game with Pygame, data visualization with Numpy, and web application development with Django. I read and did the exercises for the first half of the book but only skimmed over the second half of the book to see if anything interested me. The only chapter I took notes on in the second half involved interacting with APIs. I spent a couple hours twice a week with this book and finished in just over one month.

## What Skills I Gained

Previously I felt could hack together a Python script with Google-fu and StackOverflow but now I feel more confident in having a fresh memory of the basics to sit down and tackle a problem. I would not declare myself an expert but I would say I have a working knowledge of the language and its capabilities.

While reading this book, I noted key areas and decided to turn that into a [cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md) for further use. This is not meant to replace the book but instead meant to reinforce long term retention and aide me in not having to fully reread a Python book the next time I need to jog my memory..

**Skills I gained with this book include**

- Installing Python
- Install and configuration of VS Code with the Python extension
- Search online Python documentation and help resources
- Create and work with variables
- Create and work with strings
- Perform mathematical operations
- Create, work with, and sort lists
- Create, work with, and sort dictionaries
- Loop through lists using for loops
- Control program flow using if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements
- Use conditional tests
- Create and work with tuples
- Receive and process user input
- Repeat tasks using while and do while loops
- Create functions that accept parameters for reusable code
- Import and create modules for repeated functionality
- Use and create classes for object oriented programming
- Design and implement unit tests
- Interact with web based APIs
  
## What Skills Did I Not Gain

- Creating advanced Python scripts and tools
- Offensive security with Python

## What Books and Resources are Next

Following this book, I see a few next steps to continue my Python learning. While I won't start on these immediately, I will consider these for my long term learning path.

- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Fluent Python, 2nd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) by Luciano Ramalho
- Threat Hunting with Jupyter Notebooks
- [Black Hat Python, 2nd Edition](https://nostarch.com/black-hat-python2E) By Justin Seitz and Tim Arnold
- [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this was a great book that was helpful to jog my memory and keep a valuable skill in my toolbox. While this alone won't be enough to have my skill level where I want it to be, it has been beneficial to refamilairize myself with the language and work on additional learning resources.
