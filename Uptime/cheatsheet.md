# Uptime  
## Introduction  
- Productivity = Vision + Execution  
- Opening loops = vision  
- Closing loops = execution  
- Need to both open and close loops  
- 5 Cs of Productivity  
	1. Create - open a loop  
	2. Capture - write down loop  
	3. Consolidate - organize/prioritize  
	4. Close - execute on tasks/idea  
	5. Calm - rest/downtime to inspire new loop  
- Don’t give people a blank check on your time  
## Chapter 1  
- Identify 3 Priorities  
- Lists tasks associated with priorities  
- Print calendar and review time to priority alignment  
- Daily Urgent Block 

|                   | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **Important**     | Do it now  | Push to later  |
| **Not Important** | Delegate   | Quickly say no |

- Address issues that frequently become urgent  
## Chapter 2  
- Not all time is equal. One hour mid morning is worth more than one hour at end of the day.  
- Assign tasks based on productivity time  
- Low priority items  
	- What if I never do?  
	- Is there any other way to get it done without me doing it?  
	- Can I half do it and move on?  
- Miss 5% of flights. Value your time and don’t needlessly waste it. Assign a dollar value to your time  
- Launch and iterate: cut down on tasks/say no to things and see how they are going at a later point  
- 5 ways to say no  
	1. Ask more questions  
	2. Don’t respond right away/think about it first  
	3. Imagine outcomes of Yes and No  
	4. No but…<preempt with email/questions/delegate>  
	5. No because explain why  
## Chapter 3  
- Create a list funnel of three lists  
	- Main List - things you want to do short-medium term  
		- Break up into 6 categories, work and personal together on the same list  
		- Include due dates where possible  
		- Update as necessary, use this to populate weekly list  
	- Weekly List- items that need to be accomplished during the week  
		- Identify three priorities  
		- Other things to accomplish and days to do  
		- Themes for each day  
		- Looking ahead section for next week  
	- Daily List- items that are accomplished during the day  
		- Top priority  
		- Grateful section  
		- Other priorities  
		- Hour by hour  
		- Snack sized tasks  
	- Capture list- portable list to store things that may need to make it into main list.  
		- Use this to populate main list  
		- Make it on apple notes or Google keep  
	- Collection list - things that are a one day with no definitive plan  
		- Books  
		- Trips  
		- New skills  
		- Wants  
## Chapter 4  
- You have high energy times and low energy times  
- Power hours = high energy times  
- Off peak hours = low energy times  
- Identify when you are the most productive (2-3 hours a day) and protect that time as much as possible.  
- Off peak hours are compatible with low energy tasks. Pair these up as much as possible  
- Use a notepad and note when you have power hours and off peak hours hours for two weeks. Identify conditions during each period and try and identify a pattern.  
## Chapter 5  
- Create a calendar template for your ideal week. Make sure to include:  
	- Mandatory items  
	- Power hours and urgent blocks  
	- Off peak hours  
	- Free time (points of control)  
	- Daily themes  
- Try and give each day or half day a theme. This keeps you in one zone and not bouncing around from thing to thing  
- Aim for some unplanned days for peak productivity  
- Use your template as a reference. You won’t be 100% with it but it helps you get the right meetings in the right places.  
## Chapter 6  
- Conduct a time review periodically to see where you spend your time.  
- Look at factors like:  
	- Individual focus vs collaboration  
	- Push vs pull (get brought into meeting or drive the meeting)  
	- Personal vs work time  
	- List your responsibilities to see what appears on your calendar (and what doesn’t)  
- Recurring meetings  
- Chart recurring meetings and hours per month/quarter to see what can be cut down or reduced  
- Revisit changes to see if they were the right decision  
## Chapter 7  
- Several attributes contribute to procrastinating tasks. If you can identify and reframe the attribute, it can make it easier to work through the tasks.  
	1. Boring  
	2. Frustrating  
	3. Difficult  
	4. Ambiguous  
	5. Unstructured  
	6. Lacking reward/not fun  
	7. Not meaningful  
- Other ways to increase motivation:  
	- Break the task into smaller bits. Complete one small bit at a time and you’ll likely complete a few of the next small bits  
	- Act like your own assistant. Do all the prep work and get the task ready to work on. Come back to it later ready to hit the ground running.  
	- Stop in the middle of the task. This lets you avoid having to get over the hump of starting a task.  
	- Identify the time needed to do a task that constantly is procrastinated. You can gamify completing the task or do it when you have downtime waiting on other items.  
	- Set a meeting with someone before starting the task. This makes you accountable and creates a deadline.  
## Chapter 8  
- Identify areas where you have downtime and generate ideas (shower, walk, doing dishes)  
- Aim for one quiet hour per day to generate ideas and process information  
- Ensure you have downtime and it’s just as important as uptime.  
## Chapter 9  
- Identify if you are a home fielder (prefer work from home) or outfielder (prefer work from officer)  
- Play to the strengths of what you prefer and adjust your schedule to accommodate highest productivity tasks at the optimal place  
- Hybrid work tips: 
	- Let people know where you are  
	- Set team rules of engagement/norms  
	- Create a place and time for social interaction with coworkers  
	- Embrace asynchronous work by using tools such as comments, emails, and document collaboration  
## Chapter 10  
- Identify hot spots that are key for productivity. You may/should have multiple areas for different types of tasks.  
- Identify not spots that either aren’t conducive to work or spaces that you don’t want to associate with work(e.g., family room, kitchen)  
- Cross reference your hot spots with your daily themes. Decide where will be the best place to complete that days tasks.  
## Chapter 11  
- Set three boundaries and express them in a positive way (e.g, I only take meetings Monday - Thursday, instead of I don’t take meetings Friday)  
- Create a how to work with me document that covers preferences for other to follow  
- Enforce your boundaries but have occasional flexibility when needed  
## Chapter 12  
- Creating a plan is helpful in lowering the burden to begin items and tasks  
- A plan allows you to prepare ahead of time rather than switching gears on a dime  
- Use triggers to help get in the habit of planning. (e.g, When I run out of an item, I leave the box out until it’s been put on the shopping list)  
- Plans help future you be happy with the actions of past you  
## Chapter 13  
- Ensure every meeting is up to PAR  
	- P - Purpose  
		- Lets participants know what the reason for the meeting is  
		- Clarifies the type of meeting  
	- A - Agenda  
		- Allows delegates to ensure right people are present  
		- Informs optional participants so they can decide whether to attend  
		- Allows participants to be prepared ahead of time and read  
	- R - Result  
		- Send out brief overview of discussion, action items, and notes/transcriptions for optional participants  
- There are four types of meetings  
	- Information sharing  
	- Creative discussion  
	- Consensus discussion  
	- Connection  
- Meetings can span multiple types  
- Aim for small attendees lists  
	- Decision making ability goes down with every additional participant over seven  
- Attendees need to give value, get value, or both  
- Use optional to show you respect participants time but also want them to be informed and included  
- Cut or stretch meeting length based on agenda  
- Try and get agenda out at least 2 days in advance.  
## Chapter 14  
- Customized tools can be used more effectively than uncustomized ones. Spend 20 minutes reading the documentation or looking around the settings.  
- Customize your notifications to only display the things you want to see so you won’t break out of productivity.  
- Learn keyboard shortcuts  
## Chapter 15  
- Mitigate potential distractions ahead of time to keep you from getting off task.  
- It take on average 23 minutes to regain focus after a distraction  
- Try and check email a limited number of times per day. If this isn’t reasonable, try and close email during your power hours to create distraction free time.  
- Only multitask with low energy tasks. Never with critical tasks. If you care about the results of a task, do it by itself.  
## Chapter 16  
- Create four buckets for email that correspond to actions needed:  
	- Respond - Action needed  
	- Read - Read but not respond  
	- Revisit - Cannot immediately respond. Waiting on someone else or a certain time  
	- Relax - Actions are complete and can be archived  
- Try and empty your inbox into those four buckets. Inbox is only for things that have not been read. When it gets read, it gets assigned a bucket.  
- If you complete it in email, you don’t have to track it on one of your lists. If an email needs an action outside of email, it needs to go on a list.  
- Using search on all email is better than using folders. Use folders as a way to group things that may be hard to search for (emails that can be used for performance evals)  
## Chapter 17  
- Use “when:then” triggers to solidify new habits.  
	- When I have a quarterly performance discussion, then I make a list of items for my annual review  
	- When it’s Friday, then I prep my weekly list for the following week  
## Chapter 18  
- Pick one day of the week and don’t use tech from dinner time to bedtime. “No tech Tuesday”  
- Can start smaller by:  
	- Putting phone to bed one hour before bedtime  
	- Keep phone outside bedroom at night  
	- Do one thing before picking up phone in morning  
## Chapter 19  
- Try and carve out 30 minutes a morning for you  
	- Wednesday morning, wake up thirty minutes early and do something for you, without tech to pair with no tech Tuesdays  
- Do small 10 minute stretches of meditation every day
